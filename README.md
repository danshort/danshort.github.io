# Dan's README

This is the repo for my personal readme file, hosted through GitHub pages, at [readme.dansshorts.com](https://readme.dansshorts.com).

This site was built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev), and major parts of it were coded using [Claude](https://claude.ai) as a way to experiment with AI code generation, and learn about the pitfalls and triumphs of Agentic AI and parts of 11ty that I haven't used in the past.

It's a work in progress, like myself, and will change and evolve over time. It's small, but it works for me. Feel free to fork the repo and build your own if you'd like.

# Personal notes for me:

`npm build` to build the documents, which are placed in a `docs` folder.

`npm start` to test locally, which also builds the documents on change.

Stats are available through [Umami](https://us.umami.is/dashboard), and public statistics (I promise they will _not_ be impressive) can be viewed at the [Umami share URL](https://cloud.umami.is/share/mgCbCBMxdjBwFsyZ/readme.dansshorts.com).
