<p>A hiring manager once told me, &quot;Your resume doesn‚Äôt reflect the depth of your management experience.&quot; They were right. This document aims to correct that by providing a clearer picture of how I lead, what I prioritize, and the kind of environments I build.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve led engineering teams through rapid growth, painful reductions, complex technical transformations, and cultural resets. My approach centers on clarity, consistency, and care, whether I‚Äôm mentoring an emerging leader, managing multiple teams, or guiding senior ICs through architecture decisions. I operate with high trust, move decisively, and create space for others to thrive.</p>

<p>At CoStar, my 30-person team had an average tenure of more than five years. One engineer worked with me for over a decade. Across roles, former teammates have followed me into new companies. I‚Äôve hired engineers from <a href="http://Lynda.com">Lynda.com</a> into CoStar, brought CoStar alumni into InVision, and welcomed two former colleagues to Virtuous. I continue to mentor past team members years after we‚Äôve worked together.</p>
<p>I make it easier for people to do their best work. They stay, they grow, and they come back.</p>

        </a></h1>
<p>This is where I bring the most depth and pride. I‚Äôve guided engineers through career growth, lateral moves, and role redesigns that align better with individual strengths. One of the most rewarding journeys I‚Äôve supported was an individual who moved from Customer Support to QA, then into engineering, and ultimately into a management role over the course of a decade.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve also handled the hard parts. I‚Äôve had to part ways with engineers after investing deeply in their growth. I‚Äôve let go of underperforming managers when a team needed stronger leadership. I‚Äôve led layoffs and held over twenty separation meetings in a single day. These are difficult moments, but I handle them with clarity, ownership, and compassion. To top it off, many of those people I had separate conversations with are now mentees that I work with regularly.</p>

<p>Since 2015, I‚Äôve consistently led multiple autonomous teams. At Virtuous, I manages more than twelve direct reports across four product lines. I stay close enough to understand goals, risks, and progress, while giving each team the autonomy they need to execute well.</p>
<p>I know how to zoom out to identify systemic patterns and zoom in when a team needs targeted help. It‚Äôs a skill I‚Äôve honed across startups and distributed teams over nearly a decade.</p>

        <span aria-hidden="true">#</span>
        </a></h1>
<p>While I no longer write production code on any regular basis, I bring deep technical experience from years of full-stack development. My strengths lie in backend systems, technical architecture, and helping teams improve development velocity and reduce complexity.</p>
<p>I rely on senior ICs to dive into implementation details. My job is to ensure they have the context, support, and clarity to make good decisions. I focus on system health, trade-off awareness, and long-term maintainability, not chasing the latest framework or pulling PRs.</p>

<p>Clarity is kindness. I do not shy away from hard conversations, and I am comfortable saying, &quot;I don't know.&quot; I‚Äôve earned the trust to operate in ambiguity, assess risk, and make calls that align short-term realities with long-term goals.</p>
<p>I know when to push, when to pause, and when to let go.</p>

<p>I joined <a href="http://Land.com">Land.com</a> as employee number five and took over from the technical founder as the only engineer. I scaled the team to 30, supported two acquisitions, and led a multi-year platform consolidation effort. At InVision, I saw the org grow rapidly, then shrink, gaining firsthand experience in both scaling and rightsizing.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve spent most of my career in companies with under 200 people. I love fast-moving environments, and I know how to grow them responsibly. I'm also looking for new opportunities to expand my reach, work in larger orgs, and get first-hand experience working in even more strategic roles.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not looking for just another job. I‚Äôm looking for a team where I can make a lasting impact, support talented people, and help build something meaningful. If that sounds like the kind of leader you're looking for, let‚Äôs talk.</p>
