        <h2>Motivation for this document</h2>
        <p>My Manager README is a document that helps introduce you to my management style, philosophy, and expectations. The
        intended audience is primarily anyone who reports to me, though anyone is free to read it - or even provide feedback on
        it! Please treat it as a reference and guideline for how I will conduct myself as a manager and what I expect from you.</p>
        <p>This document is aspirational. This is how I strive to be. I'm not perfect. I have made and will continue to make
        mistakes. I urge you to hold me accountable for my promises, and I'll do the same for you. Without your feedback, I will
        not be able to improve as a manager.</p>
