                <h2>Motivation for this document</h2>
                <img class="img-fluid rounded float-end ms-3" src="headshot.jpg" />
                <p>My Manager README is a document that helps introduce you to my management style, philosophy, and expectations.
                    The intended audience is primarily anyone who reports to me, though anyone is free to read it - or even provide
                    feedback on it! Please treat it as a reference and guideline for how I will conduct myself as a manager and what
                    I expect from you.</p>
                <p>This document is aspirational. This is how I <em>strive</em> to be. I'm not perfect. I have made and will
                    continue to make
                    mistakes. I urge you to hold me accountable for my promises, and I'll do the same for you. Without your
                    feedback, I will not be able to improve as a manager.</p>
                <h2>My Role and Management Philosophy</h2>
                <p>If I were going to put my management philosophy on the cover of a book, it would be "Servant Leadership." My job
                    is to make sure that you can do your job. I want for you the same thing I want for my family; for you to be
                    <strong>happy, healthy, and successful </strong>. Here's how I judge if I'm doing a good job:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <strong>Happy:</strong> you enjoy coming to work, and you enjoy the work you do. You feel safe in your work
                        environment, and you know that we will address any issues that are reducing that happiness.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Healthy:</strong> you aren't getting burnt out. You have adequate time to decompress and spend time
                        with your
                        family (furry or otherwise), nature, or a good book. Your mental health is just as important as your
                        physical health. You know you can come to me with an issue (be it personal or professional), and we'll work
                        through it or get you the resources to work through it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Successful:</strong> you're doing good work, and you see your work make an impact in production. You
                        have a way
                        forward in your career, and you can improve yourself while improving the business. You're hitting your goals
                        and supporting the business timelines.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>I also strive to create a Leader-Leader environment (as opposed to a Leader-Follower organization [see <a
                        href="https://www.amazon.com/Turn-Ship-Around-Turning-Followers-ebook/dp/B00AFPVP0Y/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=Turn+the+Ship+Around&qid=1623019730&s=books&sr=1-3">
                        Turn the Ship Around</a>]). I'm going to work with you to define where we're going, and you're going to
                    help figure out how to get there. I won't be micro-managing or assigning specific things for you to work on.
                    I'll work with you to define the goal and let you decide how to get there (with help from me when and where you
                    need it).</p>
                <h3>Conflict Resolution</h3>
                <p>Another important part of ensuring that you're happy, healthy, and successful is ensuring that I'm helping you
                    resolve conflicts across teams or technologies. If there is a difference in approach or a misalignment on goals,
                    it will be my job to ensure that your opinion is heard and that there is clear articulation of the potential
                    approaches and documented tradeoffs to help us make informed decisions with our trio partners.</p>
                <p>Trying to get consensus in large groups is the enemy of progress. We may need to commit to an approach in cases
                    where myself, you, or the team will not agree with it. It is my job to drive a clear direction for next steps so
                    that we can <em>keep moving forward</em>. I will work to keep everyone accountable to the decision that was made
                    and
                    escalate when that is not the case. While we may have to go backward and readjust, we will have the learnings
                    from the first approach taken and can apply that to our second attempt. My ultimate goal is to keep forward
                    momentum.</p>
                <h2>What do I value most?</h2>
                <p>Transparency, curiosity, humility, trust, and a sense of humor.</p>
                <h3>Transparency and Communication</h3>
                <p>I need to know what's happening, and so do you. I will push the "why" of decisions down to the team as soon as
                    possible, and I'll leave the "how" to you. You should always know where we're going and why we're going there,
                    and I'm going to lean on you and the team to help figure out how to get there. I am <em>always</em> here to help
                    navigate that process, but those of you closest to the problems are best suited to find the solutions.</p>
                <p>Conversely, I need to know what you're working on and what problems you may be having. This doesn't mean that I
                    need status updates from you twice a day, but if something isn't going to plan or a plan is changing, I need to
                    know about it to make any necessary adjustments to account for those changes. If something is going to take you
                    three weeks longer than planned, I shouldn't hear about it 2 days before it's due.</p>
                <p>Give me plenty of heads up, as I'll be doing the same for you.</p>
                <p>I also want to make sure that everyone is communicating, async, a lot. All conversations around the work should
                    default to public spaces and only be moved into a private space if the conversation is disruptive to other
                    processes or may cause confusion for people outside of a smaller group.</p>
                <h3>Curiosity and "Always Learning"</h3>
                <p>I do very little engineering work any longer and spend most of my time focused on learning about how to be a
                    better leader. This means focusing on how to support the team, how to make sure we're planning properly, and
                    finding new ways to keep my teams happy, healthy, and successful (<em>there it is again!</em>).</p>
                <p>This means that I'm taking the time to learn new approaches to old problems, and I expect my teams to do the
                    same. I want everyone to approach problems with curiosity, not preconceived notions, and be willing to challenge
                    both their own and their teammate's assumptions. It's perfectly acceptable to have strong opinions, we're all
                    smart people, but they should be loosely held and open to challenge.</p>
                <h3>Humility and a willingness to say "I don't know"</h3>
                <p>If you don't hear me say "I don't know" at least once a day, you're probably not paying attention. I'm well aware
                    of my own limits and will never lead you to believe I know something I don't. If you assume I'm fully versed on
                    a topic then you may put too much weight on a decision I've made based on inaccurate information. If you lead me
                    to believe you know something you don't, then I'm going to lean on your supposed expertise and we may end up in
                    a bad spot. We all need to understand each other's limits to ensure that we're making the best choices possible
                    when solving problems.</p>
                <p>I've led, and continue to lead, teams working on technologies with which I have zero experience. In order to make
                    that work, we have to lean on trust.</p>
                <h3>Trust and Leaning on the Team</h3>
                <p>I'm going to tell you the truth. All the time. Even if it sucks. I expect you to do the same. This doesn't mean
                    that I'm
                    going to be harsh or unsympathetic. I am always going to lead with compassion and empathy, but I'm still going
                    to
                    deliver the truth. I want you to be open and honest with me, even if it's uncomfortable, and we'll lean on each
                    other in
                    the process.</p>
                <p>I'm also going to <em>always</em> assume good intent in async communications. It's too easy to take an off-hand
                    or careless
                    comment as a bald-faced attack. I'll trust that you're being compassionate and candid with async communication
                    until you
                    lead me to believe otherwise.</p>
                <h3>Humor</h3>
                <p>I don't take myself seriouslyâ€¦ life is too short. I'm happy to make fun of myself and lean on humor as a way to
                    de-escalate tension and help people understand when I'm being serious or light-hearted in our async text-based
                    work environment. I will <code>/giphy</code> the hell out of a conversation where it's warranted (Kristen Bell
                    and Schitt's
                    Creek gifs are my love language).</p>
                <h2>My Expectations</h2>
                <p>I won't ask you to do something I'm not willing to do or hold you to a standard to which I don't hold myself. I
                    also
                    won't take advantage of something that I don't also allow you to take advantage of.</p>

                <h2>Personality Type</h2>
                <p>I've said before that I don't put too much stock in personality types, but 16 Personalities gets pretty close (I
                    think)
                    as an <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality">Assertive Advocate</a> (INFJ-A). Here's my <a

                <h2>1:1s</h2>
                <p>You and I will have 1:1s every week or two, depending on your needs. Your 1:1s are your 1:1s, and we'll discuss
                    the topics that are most important to you. We'll keep a record of these topics in a shared document, and you
                    will drive the meetings. Expect me to ask questions and probe around the areas of your interest, but we'll keep
                    on topic and I will endeavor to not turn these into status updates (unless that's what you want).</p>
                <h2>Skip-Levels</h2>
                <p>I hold rotating skip-level 1:1s with my manager's direct reports, ideally speaking with each IC once every month
                    or two. Skip-levels are primarily to make sure that communication is making it through the organization and that
                    we all have a shared vision of where the product and processes are going. This is also an opportunity for
                    individuals in my organization to come to me with issues with their manager or colleagues that might not be
                    filtering up.</p>
                <p>This is also an opportunity for you to get to know me and my particular management style if it's not already
                    spreading out through the organization. You can ask me about my favorite coffee (I'm not picky) or what I'm
                    growing in my garden, in addition to business strategies and long-term roadmaps.</p>
                <h2>Personality Quirks</h2>
                <p>For me personally, no news is good news. I sometimes don't do a good job of letting people know they're
                    successful and meeting expectations because if something is going sideways I'll reach out to you directly. This
                    can sometimes lead to a perceived lack of communication from my direction. I work on over-communicating to try
                    and alleviate this particular flaw, but I still need practice.</p>
                <p>I'm a generalist; I know a little bit about a lot of things. I probably don't have the deep knowledge of specific
                    languages or technologies that you have. That's why I hired you ðŸ˜€ ! I'm really good at getting to the meat of a
                    problem or asking probing questions to get to the core of an issue (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys">five
                        whys</a>). Lean
                    on
                    me for troubleshooting, getting to
                    the root of an issue, and making sure that we're answering the right "why." I'll lean on you for the technical
                    know-how to make it all magic.</p>
                <p><code>TODO:</code> Talk about conflict avoidance, and how I overcome this by being (sometimes) uncomfortably

                <h2>Family &amp; Personal Life</h2>
                <p>I grew up in north Texas, moved around a bit with the military, spent time in Oregon and California, and settled
                    in the Austin, Texas area in 2006. I convinced my (now) wife to move from her home state of California, and
                    she's become a converted Texan. I have an adult son looking to get into the movie-making industry. He got
                    married on May the 4th, 2022, and I am now officially old.</p>
                <p>When I'm not at work, I'm usually spending time with my wife and close friends. We cook every meal at home, have
                    a backyard garden where we spend hours to save 10s of dollars on groceries, and enjoy making things to make our
                    nest even cozier. We like being away from the metropolitan hustle and bustle but being close enough to attend a
                    concert or musical when the mood strikes.</p>
                <p>I love tear-jerking dramas and gratuitous action flicks, and pretty much anything in between.</p>
                <p>I listen to just about any kind of music except for opera and twangy country (I grew up in Texas, but I'm a city
                    boy).</p>
                <p>I also spend quite a bit of time reading, whether that be ways to improve myself or escapism in fantasy and
                    sci-fi. You can see everything I've read or am reading on my Kindle on my GoodReads list.</p>
