# Why a README? {#why-a-readme}

Every repo worth it's bits has a `README.md` that describes the project, how it works, how to spin it up, how to contribute, all the basics you need to get the most out of that project. My Manager README is a document that helps introduce you to my management style, philosophy, and expectations. Basically, how you should expect to work with me! The intended audience is primarily anyone who reports to me, though anyone is free to read it - or even provide feedback on it! Please treat it as a reference and guideline for how I will conduct myself as a manager and what I expect from you.

This document is aspirational. This is how I _strive_ to be. I'm not perfect. I have made and will continue to make mistakes. I urge you to hold me accountable for my promises, and I'll do the same for you. Without your feedback, I will not be able to improve as a manager.

# My Role and Management Philosophy {#my-management-philosophy}

If I were going to put my management philosophy on the cover of a book, it would be "Servant Leadership." My job is to make sure that you can do your job. I want for you the same thing I want for my family; for you to be **happy, healthy, and successful**. Here's how I judge if I'm doing a good job:

* **Happy:** you enjoy coming to work, and you enjoy the work you do. You feel safe in your work environment, and you know that we will address any issues that are reducing that happiness.
* **Healthy:** you aren't getting burnt out. You have adequate time to decompress and spend time with your family (furry or otherwise), nature, or a good book. Your mental health is just as important as your physical health. You know you can come to me with an issue (be it personal or professional), and we'll work through it or get you the resources to work through it.
* **Successful:** you're doing good work, and you see your work make an impact in production. You have a way forward in your career, and you can improve yourself while improving the business. You're hitting your goals and supporting the business timelines.

I also strive to create a Leader-Leader environment (as opposed to a Leader-Follower organization [see [Turn the Ship Around](https://www.amazon.com/Turn-Ship-Around-Turning-Followers-ebook/dp/B00AFPVP0Y/)]). This style of leadership is particularly important in a fully remote environment, where we aren't always in the same room, and there is little to no direct supervision. When working remotely, team autonomy and clear communication become even more critical. I've found that successful remote teams require:

* Clear documentation of decisions and context
* Explicit trust in team members to manage their time
* Asynchronous communication as the default
* Regular, meaningful connection points that respect time zones
* A culture where results matter more than hours online

I can't be involved in every decision, so I rely on my team to make the decisions they can and then let me know where they're going. I won't be micro-managing or assigning specific things for you to work on. I'll work with you to define the goal and let you decide how to get there (with help from me when and where you need it).

I've written some more about my [management history and experience](/management/).

## Conflict Resolution

Another important part of ensuring that you're happy, healthy, and successful is ensuring that I'm helping you resolve conflicts across teams or technologies. If there is a difference in approach or a misalignment on goals, it will be my job to ensure that your opinion is heard and that there is clear articulation of the potential approaches and documented tradeoffs to help us make informed decisions with our trio partners. The cliché about Product and Engineering being constantly in tension is a cliché because it's often true. It's my job to help Product understand the constraints under which we're operating, and to ensure that Engineering knows the priorities and can help move Product's priorities forward as quickly and efficiently as possible. Cross-functional alignment isn't always easy, but it's always possible.

When security or vulnerability concerns arise, I ensure they get proper attention and aren't sacrificed for speed or features. Building this balance between security, functionality, and usability is a delicate art that requires constant attention from leadership, and a clear communication of the importance of these fixes to stakeholders outside of Engineering and Security.

Trying to get consensus in large groups is the enemy of progress. We may need to commit to an approach in cases where myself, you, a partner, or the team will not agree with it. It is my job to drive a clear direction for next steps so that we can _keep moving forward_. I will work to keep everyone accountable to the decision that was made and escalate when that is not the case. While we may have to go backward and readjust, we will have the learnings from the first approach taken and can apply that to our second attempt. My ultimate goal is to keep forward momentum.

# What do I value most? {#what-do-i-value}

Transparency, curiosity, humility, trust, and a sense of humor.

## Transparency and Communication

I need to know what's happening, and so do you. I will push the "why" of decisions down to the team as soon as possible, and I'll leave the "how" to you. You should always know where we're going and why we're going there, and I'm going to lean on you and the team to help figure out how to get there. I am _always_ here to help navigate that process, but those of you closest to the problems are best suited to find the solutions.

Conversely, I need to know what you're working on and what problems you may be having. This doesn't mean that I need status updates from you twice a day, but if something isn't going to plan or a plan is changing, I need to know about it to make any necessary adjustments to account for those changes. If something is going to take you three weeks longer than planned, I shouldn't hear about it 2 days before it's due.

Give me plenty of heads up, as I'll be doing the same for you.

You can count on me to advocate for your work in all directions. I'll make sure your progress and goals are visible at the C-level and well-communicated across adjacent teams, including product, support, and peer engineering groups alike. Effective cross-functional communication is critical to how we partner with GTM, Sales, Partnerships, and Product Marketing. These teams need clear, timely updates on what we're building, changing, and shipping, because their success depends on ours.

I also want to make sure that everyone is communicating, async, a lot. All conversations around the work should default to public spaces and only be moved into a private space if the conversation is disruptive to other processes or may cause confusion for people outside of a smaller group.

## Curiosity and "Always Learning" {#curiosity-and-always-learning}

I do very little engineering work any longer and spend most of my time focused on learning about how to be a better leader. This means focusing on how to support the team, how to make sure we're planning properly, and finding new ways to keep my teams happy, healthy, and successful ( _there it is again!_ ).

This means that I'm taking the time to learn new approaches to old problems, and I expect my teams to do the same. I want everyone to approach problems with curiosity, not preconceived notions, and be willing to challenge both their own and their teammate's assumptions. It's perfectly acceptable to have strong opinions, we're all smart people, but they should be loosely held and open to challenge.

## Humility and a willingness to say "I don't know" {#humility-and-i-dont-know}

"Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less."
-- Rick Warren

If you don't hear me say "I don't know" at least once a day, you're probably not paying attention. I'm well aware of my own limits and will never lead you to believe I know something I don't. If you assume I'm fully versed on a topic then you may put too much weight on a decision I've made based on inaccurate information. If you lead me to believe you know something you don't then I'm going to lean on your supposed expertise and we may end up in a bad spot. We all need to understand each other's limits to ensure that we're making the best choices possible when solving problems.

I've led, and continue to lead, teams working on technologies with which I have zero experience. In order to make that work, we have to trust each other and be transparent about what we do or don't fully grok.

## Trust and Leaning on the Team

I'm going to tell you the truth. All the time. Even if it sucks. I expect you to do the same. This doesn't mean that I'm going to be harsh or unsympathetic. I am always going to lead with compassion and empathy, but I'm still going to deliver the truth. I want you to be open and honest with me, even if it's uncomfortable, and we'll lean on each other in the process.

I'm also going to _always_ assume good intent in async communications. It's too easy to take an off-hand or careless comment as a bald-faced attack. I'll trust that you're being compassionate and candid with async communication until you lead me to believe otherwise.

## Humor

I don't take myself seriously… life is too short. I'm happy to make fun of myself and lean on humor as a way to de-escalate tension and help people understand when I'm being serious or light-hearted in our async text-based work environment. I will `/giphy` the hell out of a conversation where it's warranted (Kristen Bell and Schitt's Creek gifs are my love language).

## Security Mindset and Building Trust

As a leader in technology, I recognize that trust is earned through consistent attention to security and privacy. Throughout my career, I've emphasized a few key principles:

* **Security is everyone's responsibility** - not just a specialized team's concern
* **Privacy and security are foundational** - not features to be added later
* **Transparency about security practices** builds trust with users
* **Good security feels invisible** to users while protecting them completely

I encourage teams to integrate security thinking from the earliest design phases and make it part of our definition of done. In practice, this means regular security reviews, encouraging team members to raise concerns, and working closely with security specialists to implement best practices.

The most secure systems are those built by teams who understand that protecting user data is part of delivering value, not an obstacle to it. This mindset creates the foundation for software that users can trust with their most sensitive information.

# My Expectations

I won't ask you to do something I'm not willing to do or hold you to a standard to which I don't hold myself. I also won't take advantage of something that I don't also allow you to take advantage of.

## Work Quality

You are responsible for the quality of your work that goes to production. No QAE or Automation Engineer is responsible for making sure that you're producing the best quality software you're capable of. This means that you need to take responsibility for edge cases, unit testing, and ensuring that your PRs are clean and as bug-free as they can be. Lean on your QAEs to help you define those test cases, ensure you're hitting the edge cases, and looking around corners, but you are the final stop for the quality for your work.

## Communication

All I expect in our communications is honesty, candor, and timeliness. Make sure you let me know what's happening when it's happening, particularly if it's going to require my attention or involve reassigning resources to a problem. Own your mistakes, and let me know what you're doing to rectify the situation. As a young engineer I once deleted all user accounts in production at Lynda.com because I neglected to highlight the `WHERE` clause in a `DELETE` statement in SSMS, and I hadn't wrapped the statement in a transaction. I spent the next 12 hours "testing our backups" as I recovered the data, and I continued to be employed at Lynda until I left a year later for a new role. I made a terrible mistake, I owned it, and I corrected it. I also learned how _not_ to run queries in SSMS.

I expect everyone on my teams to operate the same way.

## Availability

As a manager and leader I will do my best to be available to you during your work hours. Operating in a global marketplace with the possiblity of engineers on opposite sides of the world working on the same team, this may not always be possible. I set limits on my availability, and will put my devices on DnD when I need to spend time with family or rest and recharge.

I'll expect the latter of you, but not the former. I expect that you'll be available during your defined core work hours, and will let me know when you won't be available. The most frustrating situation for a leader is to be dealing with an emergency and be unable to reach your team when they should be on-call or during their core work hours. I expect you to disconnect when you're not on-call and you're outside your core work hours. You should, ideally, never see a message from me outside of those hours. If I need something I'll set up a scheduled Slack message to contact you when you're back online.

# Personality Type

I've said before that I don't put too much stock in personality types, but 16 Personalities gets pretty close (I think) as an [Assertive Advocate](https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality) (INFJ-A). Here's my [full profile on 16 Personalities](https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/0a91e592ff94e).

# 1:1s {#one-on-ones}

You and I will have 1:1s every week or two, depending on your needs. Your 1:1s are your 1:1s, and we'll discuss the topics that are most important to you. We'll keep a record of these topics in a shared document, and you will drive the meetings. Expect me to ask questions and probe around the areas of your interest, but we'll keep on topic and I will endeavor to not turn these into status updates (unless that's what you want).

# Skip-Levels

I hold rotating skip-level 1:1s with my manager's direct reports, ideally speaking with each IC once every month or two. Skip-levels are primarily to make sure that communication is making it through the organization and that we all have a shared vision of where the product and processes are going. This is also an opportunity for individuals in my organization to come to me with issues with their manager or colleagues that might not be filtering up.

This is also an opportunity for you to get to know me and my particular management style if it's not already spreading out through the organization. You can ask me about my favorite coffee (I'm not picky) or what I'm growing in my garden, in addition to business strategies and long-term roadmaps.

# Personality Quirks

For me personally, no news is good news. I sometimes don't do a good job of letting people know they're successful and meeting expectations because if something is going sideways I'll reach out to you directly. This can sometimes lead to a perceived lack of communication from my direction. I work on over-communicating to try and alleviate this particular flaw, but I still need practice.

I'm a generalist; I know a little bit about a lot of things. I probably don't have the deep knowledge of specific languages or technologies that you have. That's why I hired you 😀 ! I'm really good at getting to the meat of a problem or asking probing questions to get to the core of an issue ([five whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys)). Lean on me for troubleshooting, getting to the root of an issue, and making sure that we're answering the right "why." I'll lean on you for the technical know-how to make it all magic.

# Family & Personal Life {#family-and-personal-life}

I grew up in north Texas, moved around a bit with the military after High School, spent time in Oregon and California, and settled in the Austin, Texas area in 2006. I convinced my (now) wife to move from her home state of California, and she's become a converted Texan. I have an adult son looking to get into the movie-making industry.

When I'm not at work, I'm usually spending time with my wife and close friends. We cook every meal at home, have a backyard garden where we spend hours to save 10s of dollars on groceries, and enjoy making things to make our nest even cozier. We like being away from the metropolitan hustle and bustle but being close enough to grab some sushi or attend a concert or musical when the mood strikes.

In 2022 we took a month-long road trip around the North East US and absolutely loved it. I'm looking forward to spending more time traveling in the future, and exploring the world with my lovely wife.

I love tear-jerking dramas and gratuitous action flicks, and pretty much anything in between.

I listen to just about any kind of music except for opera and twangy country (I grew up in Texas, but I'm a city boy).

I also spend quite a bit of time reading, whether that be ways to improve myself or escapism in fantasy and sci-fi. You can see everything I've read or am reading on my Kindle on my GoodReads list.

Work in progress, may be ugly
