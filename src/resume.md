## VP Engineering Candidate | Engineering Executive | Organizational Leader

Engineering executive with 20+ years of experience scaling software teams, launching mission-critical products, and aligning engineering orgs with business strategy. I lead with clarity, empathy, and urgency—building high-retention, high-accountability teams that deliver results.

What sets me apart is my ability to simplify the complex: whether it's navigating due diligence for a $100M investment, guiding multi-team product launches, or aligning engineering with go-to-market plans, I thrive at the intersection of execution and communication. I'm passionate about secure, impactful software that drives measurable change—and creating environments where people love to do their best work.

## Leadership Philosophy

I believe great engineering leadership is grounded in clarity, candor, and care. I work hard to create a space where high standards and high trust coexist—and where people are energized to do the best work of their careers. I believe in servant leadership, systems thinking, and shared wins. And I believe engineering is at its best when it’s aligned tightly to customer value and business impact.
